        "Telecom churn analysis is the process of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their service or switch to a different service provider. This is an important problem for telecom companies, as churn can have a significant impact on their revenue and profitability. Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset consists of cleaned customer activity data and a label specifying whether a customer has churned. The goal of the analysis is to understand the factors that contribute to churn and develop strategies to reduce churn by targeting those factors. The first step in conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for telecom churn analysis is data acquisition, which involves obtaining a representative sample of data from the telecom company including customer demographic information, usage patterns, and churn status. The next step is data cleaning, which involves removing any missing or incomplete data and ensuring that the data is in a format that can be easily analyzed. Data visualization involves using plots and charts to visualize the data and identify trends and patterns, while data summarization involves using statistical techniques to summarize the data and understand the relationships between different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "To reduce churn and improve customer retention, it is important to take a proactive approach. One effective strategy is to modify the International Plan so that the charges are the same as the normal plan. This will help address any potential dissatisfaction with higher charges for international usage. Communication and asking for feedback often can help to identify and address any issues that may lead to churn. Offering promotions periodically can also help to retain customers, as can focusing on customers experiencing problems in states with high churn rates. Paying attention to your best customers and ensuring they receive the support they need is also important. Regular server maintenance and addressing poor network connectivity issues can also help to reduce churn. Developing a roadmap for onboarding new customers can help to ensure a smooth onboarding process and reduce the likelihood of churn. Analyzing churn when it occurs can provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to churn, which can inform strategies for reducing churn. Finally, it is important to stay competitive by keeping up with industry trends and continuously improving the customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through EDA of the churn dataset, it was found that the charge fields are directly related to the minute fields, the area code may not be relevant and can be excluded, customers with the International Plan tend to churn more often, customers who have had four or more customer service calls churn significantly more than other customers, customers with high day and evening minute usage tend to churn at a higher rate, and there is no clear relationship between churn and the number of calls made or received. In conclusion, to reduce churn and improve customer retention, telecom companies should focus on modifying the International Plan, being proactive with communication and asking for feedback, offering promotions, focusing on customers experiencing problems in states with high churn rates, paying attention to their best customers, and continuously improving the customer experience."
